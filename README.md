# FSX Random Airports Picker

## What is this?
This is a Ruby on Rails application.

## Who is this for?
For Microsoft Flight Simulator X (MFSX or FSX for short) Gold Edition pilots who are bored and want to fly something new.

## What does it do?
If you give it two ICAO airport codes, it will generate a random flight path between those two airports.
If you don't, it will generate a random flight path between two random airports.
It may randomly split the path into waypoints (other airports) if your aircraft's range is smaller than the total distance.
If you don't select an aircraft, it will pick a random one.
If you don't select a country, it will search airports in all countries.
It shows the flight path on a Google map along with waypoints data.

## Requirements
Ruby 1.9.2, Rails, MySQL, Apache2 etc.
This means you better have a Linux/Mac laptop nearby.

## Fastest Installation
    git clone git://github.com/ollie/fsx_random_airports_picker.git
    cd fsx_random_airports_picker
    bundle install
    rake db:create db:migrate db:data:load:latest
    rails s
Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/.

## Seeding
If you don't want to load data directly from YAML (that is `db:data:load:latest`),
you will need to run rake db:seed, which populates the database manually.
It does the following:

* Saves aircrafts,
* Parses fs10.Airports.dat,
* Saves countries,
* Saves airports,
* Saves runways,
* Parses airports.csv,
* Saves airport names (they are not in fs10.Airports.dat file).

This might take around 20 minutes or so.
